## This project is for Payever company Frontend Egineering technical test 

The technical task is to create a simple calender application from scratch. to reduce the implentation time, please make use of Angular Material and the Angular CDK (this is a must)


## The Calender app should consist of:
1. Form to add a calender appointment
2. Ability to delete the appointment
3. Ability to move the appointment
4. Use Date() to work with time/date
5. Implement mouse Drag&Drop using Angular CDK
6. Ngfor to render calender dates and appointments (calender view)

## Therefore its mandatory that you corectly use:
 - Dependency Injection
 - Lazyloadfor module/routes
 - Adding router, router-oputlets, etc
 - Use angular forms, with value changes, validators, etc.
 - Use RXJS in any extent possible
 - Use standalone component and/or shared
